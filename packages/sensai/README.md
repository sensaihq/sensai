The framework to simply and quickly build enterprise grade APIs.

As a developer, you often find yourself spending precious time setting up tooling, adding plugins and middlewares, parsing requests, and returning the correct data. The list seems endless, and it's hard to keep up! Sensai abstracts all of that, removing all points of friction so that you can focus on what really matters: effortlessly building your business logic.

- **Zero configuration**
- **File-system based router**
- **Live reload and automatic bundling**
- **First class TypeScript support**
- and [more](https://sensai.sh/docs#features)

We have [many ideas](https://feedback.sensai.sh/roadmap) for making sensai an exceptional framework. Instead of implementing everything at once, we aim to introduce features gradually and validate them with our community, so they can be tailor-made to meet your needs.
